title: "Lab 10: Grid Localization using Bayes Filter "

### Objective
In this lab the goal is to use a Bayes filter to predict the robots location

### Prelab

Setting up simulator was difficult. I have been doing all the labs on Linux so there were a few issues getting the simulator setup. One issue was using pip to install ipywidgets was not updating it to the latest version, so it needed to be uninstalled and then reinstalled with sudo. Additionally, I had another issue with the qt6 library. With help from the TA's, we tried a few of the fixes from this [forum](https://forum.qt.io/topic/93247/qt-qpa-plugin-could-not-load-the-qt-platform-plugin-xcb-in-even-though-it-was-found). I do not know which command fixed it. I just hope that anyone in the future who uses Linux for this class can get some help from this.
