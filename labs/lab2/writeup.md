# Prelab
Setting up my computer for the lab was an incredibly difficult process. I am running a Windows 11 PC. Due to an unknown bug I am unable to connect to bluetooth using Windows 11. What I instead did was installed the latest version of [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and set up a dual boot for my PC. After following the provided setup process for installing python and the starter code my computer was able to connect with the Artemis Nano.

To initially connect to the Artemis I first had it print out its MAC adress. This was because the class has a batch of Artemis Boards which can have repeating MAC adresses. Additiionally I had the Jupyter Notebook print out a unique UUID to allow the computer and the Artemis to connect. Without a unique UUID I would have been able to accidentally connect to someone elses Artemis. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123790450/218936223-58eb0ee1-40bf-448c-a938-64925845a9c7.png)
