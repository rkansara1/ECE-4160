Lab 1: The Artemis Board
=====
# Objective
The purpose of this lab was to get set up with the Arduino IDE and the Artemis Nano board. I worked through the following example sketches.

# Examples

## Example 1: Blink it Up

This example was very straightforward to setup. All that needs to be done is to go to Files>Examples>01.Basics>Blink. Uploading that file will have the Artemis blinking. The baud rate needs to be changed to 115200. The video below shows the Artemis board blinking.
