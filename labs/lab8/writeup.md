Lab 8: Stunts
---

In this lab I set out to achieve Task A. To peform Task A the robot needs to drive towards the wall, execute a flip when it is on the black pad, and then drive back past the starting line. To achieve this I modified the code I had written for Lab 7. The only addition was a piece of code that caused the robot to flip when it got close enough and drive backwards. In my testing, I found that to have the robot stop on the black pad it needed to execute the stop at around 900 mm away from the wall.
